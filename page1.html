    <p id="subtitle">A brief introduction</p>   

<div class="guardian1">
    <p id="page1txt">During a previous bootcamp with Codenation I worked as part of a team to create a text-based adventure game using Python. The criteria we had to meet was that our game must allow the player to make their own choices which will effect gameplay. We mainly did this using if statements and a global variable that increased in value depending on player choices, which would influence which ending of three the player will recieve. I took on the role of team leader, assigning tasks to team members, leading project discussions and recieving input from team members and deciding how we will structure our approach after whittling down ideas. I also wrote all of the story dialogue (minus the endings and boss fights) and coded two levels of the story by myself; The Poison Garden and The Throne Room.</p>

<div class="guardian2">
    <p id="page1txt">In regards to the gameplay, the plot revolves around the NPC character named by the player, and you as the player take on the role of their guardian angel, intervining when necessary unknown to anyone else (at first). You must help the player to reclaim their rightful throne from the evil entity that currently rules. To the left you can see the poison garden level, which offers a choice of paths to take, ending with a riddle that I came up with myself. See if you can guess the answer!</p>

    <p id="subtitle">My Last Website</p>

<div class="guardian1">
    <p id="page1txt">Here you can see a screenshow of my previous website, which is also the first website I've ever made. I intentionally went for a retro videogame look inspired by old space themed arcade games. The brief asked for an "about me" website, so I decided to write about my zodiac signs since I came across some glowing zodiac PNG files that I thought would look amazing against a far-out space themed background. I think I brought justice to a simple retro concept but this time I thought I'd go for something a little bit more professional- to develop my skills further while also proving my capability to follow a reference and to make something that looks nice and professional.</p>
